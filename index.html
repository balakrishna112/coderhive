The bigger problem is that there aren’t enough talented engineers for the jobs available in the market. CoderHive has taken a small step towards the solution. Its a launchpad for anyone who want get into technology.</p>

            <p>Programming was not my cup of tea in college. I was at level 0. I wasn't sure that this would work for me. But now I am able to think logically and solve various coding challenges. I am grateful for the CoderHive's great environment and mentors, especially the unconventional way of teaching and learning. One should never miss the experience at CoderHive</p>
